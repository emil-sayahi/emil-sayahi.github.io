Hello! I'm Emil Sayahi, a script kid from Cincinnati who doesn't know what to do with their life. This is my website, which I'll use to catalogue all the various things I may or may not do over time. Hopefully, four years down the line I'll have a portfolio of work that'll be presentable and filled with things that'll show the kind of work ethic and knowledge I have.
