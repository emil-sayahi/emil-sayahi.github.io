Hello! I'm Emil Sayahi, a scriptkiddie from Cincinnati who doesn't know what to do with his life. This is my website, which I'll use to catalogue all the various things I may or may not do over time. Eventually, I'll have a portfolio of work that'll be presentable and filled with things that'll show the kind of work ethic and knowledge I have. Actually, I'm writing this sentence in my senior year of highschool now and I've done nothing, so nevermind. I got a bit ahead of myself, didn't I? Haha.
