Heyo, I'm Emil, an American script kid in Cincinnati who likes tinkerin' around! I program, design user interfaces, and do work in CAD component part modeling. This is my 'about me' website, which I'll use to catalogue all the various things I've done over time. Hopefully, by four years after I've set up this site I'll have a portfolio of work that'll be presentable; filled with things that'll show the kind of work ethic and knowledge I have. 

### Education & Experience

I currently attend Turpin High School, a suburban public school that has been able to provide many great opportunities, including:
- A programming course covering Python and constructs present in most languages (Comments, booleans, 'if' statements, comparison operators, logical operations, short circuit evaluation, De Morgan's laws, floating point numbers, 'while' loops, 'for' loops, 'break' and 'continue', nested control structures, functions (+ parameters & return values), exception handling, indexing & slicing, string immutability, slicing & concatenation, the 'in' keyword, various string methods, tuples, lists, and list methods.)
- An engineering course that involved learning CAD modeling.
- A STEM course that required us to learn basic 3D modeling in Sketchup.

Besides my school education, I've taught myself VB.NET (the Microsoft .NET Framework version of Visual Basic), some C#, some JavaScript, and a far amount of HTML & CSS. A good example to show to demonstrate my computer competence would be the very existence of this website. Just to get this website up, I had to solve the following problems:
1. How can I manage my code under a version control system for easy revisioning?
2. How can I obtain a domain name along with hosting to put the website out there?
3. How should the site be designed from a visual standpoint. What are the intended aesthetics?
4. How can I use freely available online resources to become proficient enough in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete the website?
5. How do I keep the communications between incoming connections and the website managed and secure?

If I was without competence, knowledge, and a good work ethic, you wouldn't be reading this now would you?

### Work
I'm be focusing on making my highschool career a four year period of professional development and learning, so I can have more to present to you. I'll leave you alone now. Go and take a look at what I have here. If you want to contact me, shoot me an e-mail at: [`em@emsa.cf`](mailto:em@emsa.cf?subject=I'm gonna make you a billionaire! ...). Seeya.

**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- JavaScript


## [3D Modeling](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Sketchup-House/)
I had to model an entire house and the things inside of it a couple years ago for a generic STEM class in middle school. Take a look.
<br>
**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- Sketchup
- 3D modeling


## [Hello Plugin](https://github.com/EmilSayahi/Hello-Plugin)
This was a simple SourceMod plugin for Source Engine game servers. It printed "Hello!" in the chat when activated by the command /hello. For testing purposes.
<br>
**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- SourceMod
- SourcePawn


## [Calculator](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Calculator)
Just a calculator? Yep. This was a calculator made in VB.NET many, many years ago. I found it and put it up on GitHub to prove that I can use Visual Studio and that I know VB.NET to a certain extent. Not much else to say on it.
<br>
**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- VB.NET
- Visual Studio


## [TryMath](http://emsa.cf/trymath.html)
A test in getting math text to render on the site. When it did, I decided to make a Python script to calculate the crazy equation I rendered.
<br>
**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Interface design


## [OpenTK Rendering Experiment](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/TriBox)
This was a rendering program that was intended to be a game engine using OpenGL, written in C#, based on a collection of model loader classes called Meshomatic. It could load basic .OBJ models. Mainly what I managed to accomplish with this was loading in different kinds of models and manipulating their positions on screen by transforming the camera.
<br>
**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- C#
- Visual Studio


## [Isla Delphiino](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Isla-Delphiino)
A UI that was an extremely accurate replication of the Wii system settings UI, which demonstrated the ability to reverse engineer user interfaces by performing visual and functional analysis of the UI.
<br>
**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- VB.NET
- Visual Studio
- Interface design
- Reverse engineering


## [Lime School](https://limeschool.cf)
This is a school blog that contains the work of the classes I've taken that have asked me to host a blog. Code is on GitHub, and it runs on Jekyll. Taught me how to use a CMS, markdown, Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare.
<br>
**SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES**:
- GitHub
- SiteLeaf

## [A personal upload center](https://liech.ga/up/)
A webpage which shows the files I've uploaded to my personal website. Files smaller than 1,000 characters are saved to RAM,
making file downloads quicker and more reliable, taking up less bandwidth by making a connection once per pageview to download any file rather than a connection per download. This uses the GitHub API and demonstrates the ability to create a nice looking yet simple and functional user interface.
